# Console-Finances

The app is used for analyzing the financial records of a company. The financial dataset is stored in the `index.js` file.

The app calculates the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

The final result is shown in the console and in the browser.
